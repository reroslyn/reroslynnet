# reroslynnet
Roslyn analysis toolset

#about reRoslyn
Since the new Roslyn-Compiler-Platform supports easy-to-use code-analysis and code-fixes, this project will bring a set of mostly used and nearly standard code-analysis, refactoring and code-formatting tools for every developer easy and free to use.

Code analysis and refactorings will be configureable and also useable during builds. The Rulesets will be defined per language.

We'd like to implement best practices from resharper and other refactoring tools.
